## Planning for the coming year for the Vermont Development Network!

As the interest and size of the Vermont Development Network grows (there
are almost 100 people on our mailing list!) I thought it would be wise
to hold a planning meeting. So far we've held several happy hours,
a lightning talk Irene fundraiser, and participated in a Career night at
UVM. However, I'd like to get a more regular schedule down and plan out
events for the next several months. If you're interested in shaping the
direction of VTDevNet, please join us at [Maglianero Cafe](http://blog.maglianero.com/) in downtown Burlington on December 8, 2011 from 5:30-7pm.
