## About us

Our little state needs a group dedicated to international development
discussion/networking for the many companies and scattered private
consultants to get together, share a beverage, and chat. Face time vs.
phone and email time - so we've created the **Vermont Development Network!**

The goal is to provide a space for Vermonters interested in
international development issues and topics to network with one another,
have a little intellectual show & tell, and talk shop - whatever you
like! We plan to hold informal gatherings, discussions, and community
building events with related organizations. This is a way to deepen our
professional rolodexes, requires no output but the price of beverages,
a bit of time to attend a happy hour here and there, and openness to
hanging out with like-minded professionals. We all wear jeans sometimes.

We will start out here in Chittenden County but with networks up and
down the state, look toward Windham and points east. We've also started
a LinkedIn Group (Vermont Development Network), a Facebook Group (same
name), a Twitter account (VTDevNet), and are looking into Meet-up as
well. Feel free to join/”like”/follow!

### Our First Event!

A Happy Hour of course! No talks yet, just an opportunity to grab
a beverage and chat with your fellow VTDevNetters. Come join us at
Bistro 156 for a few appetizers and a chance to meet other international
development colleagues. We'll have the sidewalk-facing area to
ourselves.
