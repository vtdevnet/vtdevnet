## Come out and celebrate Oktoberfest with the Vermont Development Network. 

Say goodbye to FY'11 and  proposal season! No talks this month, just an
opportunity to grab a beverage and chat with your fellow VTDevNetters.
Come join us downstairs in the basement of [The Farmhouse Tap and Grill](http://farmhousetg.com/), in Burlington for a drink and a chance to meet other international development colleagues.
