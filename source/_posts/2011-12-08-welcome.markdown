The Vermont Development Network (VTDevNet) was formed to help people working in
developing countries and on issues of international development network
to share best practices, resources, and their experiences. The goal is to foster an
environment where people can network with each other and leverage their
experiences to better their work in this field. We hold regular happy
hours, and are starting to have events and panel discussions.
